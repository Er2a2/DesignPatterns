# Design Patterns in C#

This repository contains practical and well-structured implementations of common **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** in C#.  
Each pattern includes:

- A clear explanation (README inside each folder)  
- A basic/minimal example  
- A practical, real-world example  
- Clean, maintainable, object-oriented code  
- Extensible handler chains / strategies / etc.  

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate not only **how** each pattern works,  
but also **how it can be applied to real-world projects**.

##   Available Patterns

### 1. **Chain of Responsibility**
Folder: `ChainOfResponsibility/`

Includes:
- **BasicExample** — Minimal, beginner-friendly implementation  
- **SpamDetectionExample** — Real-world email spam checking pipeline  

---

### 2️. **Strategy Pattern**
Folder: `Strategy/`

Includes:
- **BasicExample** — Simple and clear demonstration of switching strategies at runtime  
- **PaymentStrategyExample** — Real-world payment selection (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer)

---

### 3️. Factory Method
Folder: `FactoryMethod/`

Includes:

##  Purpose of This Repository


This repo is meant for:

- Interview preparation  
- Reference material for real-world architecture  
- Personal learning & clean coding practice  
- Understanding SOLID principles (especially **OCP**, **DIP**, **SRP**)  

More patterns will be added over time.
