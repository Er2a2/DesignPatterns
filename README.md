# Design Patterns in C#

This repository contains practical and well-structured implementations of common **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** in C#.  
Each pattern includes:

- A clear explanation (README inside each folder)  
- A basic/minimal example  
- A practical, real-world example  
- Clean, maintainable, object-oriented code  
- Extensible handler chains / strategies / etc.  

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate not only **how** each pattern works,  
but also **how it can be applied to real-world projects**.
